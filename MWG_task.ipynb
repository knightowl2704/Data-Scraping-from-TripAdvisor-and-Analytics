It was then I looked around and read messages on walls, fliers and menu cards about the Kitchen with a Cause! The air around me was very still and the staff seemed very unwelcoming of us. I wondered what the reason was! In walked 2 groups of Foreigners (around 20 odd people) accompanied by their Indian Handlers (read Dalla).The scene immediately changed. The waiters were smiling and cheerful, the barman was juggling beers and their handlers (dallas) were explaining to them what the cause was. Now let me tell you the cause first hand- create a cafe, create so much sympathy, bring in customers who smile, have beers and donate generously seeing the street children and hearing their misery-laced stories from the handlers. The guests are then asked to donate generously for this cause. All this happened in front of my eyes and not once but many times post which I realized this place is a Scam.

Like many other westerners who have reviewed this restaurant, we also went there for dinner because we thought the place was doing some good. The food took ages to arrive, was overpriced and not to local standards- more like Tesco packaged food that the western palate is used to. Especially the Shahi paneer which was full of sugar and red colouring. It had no cashew paste, traditional spices or ghee. I grew up locally so I should know what authentic food tastes like. We did not pay for it as we could not eat (but this took some convincing). My hakka noodles were okay, though the other paneer we ordered was to give my son stomach problems in the morning. The ambience was poor with bad acoustics- some timber palettes hung from the ceiling which obviously the designer of the restaurant had seen in some trendy Western restaurant but in this case, had been specially made!!! As an architect, I though the layout was very poor. There was a family getting drunk and making a lot of noise but the manager was too timid to stop them. But more worryingly, we did not get proper answers about their charitable cause. We were told that they supported street kids but I did not see a charity registration number. We did not see any street kids there and their first 'intern' who has given an interview on their facebook page doesn't give any details of what he learned. He doesn't appear to a be street kid, but a well educated adult. I talked to some street kinds in the area and they had never heard of this restaurant and neither had the local business association. We never went there again but instead visited the authentic South Indian restaurant next door (we also saw some of KWAC staff there!).
