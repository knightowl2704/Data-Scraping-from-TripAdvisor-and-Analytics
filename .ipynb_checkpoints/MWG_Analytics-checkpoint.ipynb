       "0    This place is swarming with Gadventurers and CEOs and the food is quite good, especially their garlic naan, my favorite.  Almost all their dishes are exceptionally good.  Came here three times and tried different dishes on the menu....never disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1    Visited about a week ago and we  were very impressed with the food service and gereral ambience of this very clean and slick restaurant. It is well worth a visit if in the area and prices are good. We will be returning soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2    I enjoyed a fantastic meal at KWAC thanks to Brikash Sharma our excellent guide while spending sometime in New Delhi recently. We were a table of 15+ South Africans so appreciated the giving back ethos of supporting the under privileged and street people. My meal was delicious and well priced. I highly recommend to all “westerners” wanting to support local smaller restaurants. Namaste                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3    This is a lovely hidden gem in Karol Bagh, walking distance from the metro. The restaurant is beautiful with great food at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly & competent also goes the extra mile if you want to celebrate a birthday or get together. They baked the most delicious chocolate cake and made my friends birthday extra special. So happy our tour guide Miksa took us there. I can highly recommend this restaurant to all my traveling buddies & friends visiting Delhi from South Africa.          \n",
       "4    The restaurant is a social project, so 5 stars just for it. Talking about the restaurant:- Food: wide variety of Indian dishes- Service: super kind and fast- Quality: very good (although some dishes are interpreted in the wrong way, the springs rolls and the fried rice. They were good and tasty, but do not expect the \"traditional\" dish).- Place: super clean - Price: super fair!Therefore, I would surely come back. :)                                                                                         \n",

Apart from being the best presented food we had during our trip, it tasted lovely too. I stuck with vegetarian, but the meat received good comments from our group too.

We started with drinks from their large selection of smoothies, shakes, lassi and juices, all freshly prepared and artfully presented. Our food choices were made from a good selection of traditional Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes as well as salads, Chinese and Continental dishes. The food and drinks were delicious, beautifully presented and enjoyed by all members of our group.   \n",

       "0    This place is swarming with Gadventurers and CEOs and the food is quite good, especially their garlic naan, my favorite.  Almost all their dishes are exceptionally good.  Came here three times and tried different dishes on the menu....never disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

It is well worth a visit if in the area and prices are good. We will be returning soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2    I enjoyed a fantastic meal at KWAC thanks to Brikash Sharma our excellent guide while spending sometime in New Delhi recently. We were a table of 15+ South Africans so appreciated the giving back ethos of supporting the under privileged and street people. My meal was delicious and well priced. I highly recommend to all “westerners” wanting to support local smaller restaurants. Namaste                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3    This is a lovely hidden gem in Karol Bagh, walking distance from the metro. The restaurant is beautiful with great food at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly & competent also goes the extra mile if you want to celebrate a birthday or get together. They baked the most delicious chocolate cake and made my friends birthday extra special. So happy our tour guide Miksa took us there. I can highly recommend this restaurant to all my traveling buddies & friends visiting Delhi from South Africa.          \n",
       "4    The restaurant is a social project, so 5 stars just for it. Talking about the restaurant:- Food: wide variety of Indian dishes- Service: super kind and fast- Quality: very good (although some dishes are interpreted in the wrong way, the springs rolls and the fried rice. They were good and tasty, but do not expect the \"traditional\" dish).- Place: super clean - Price: super fair!Therefore, I would surely come back. :)                                                                                         \n",
